    <string name="intro_1">Hello? Is anyone receiving this?</string>
    <string name="intro_1_response">Hello? Who is this?</string>
    <string name="intro_2">Thank god! I\'ve been transmitting for weeks. I thought there were no Nochies left</string>
    <string name="intro_2_response">Nochies? What are you talking about? Who <i>are</i> you?</string>
    <string name="intro_3">Nochies. You know, no-tech people. Ones who escaped The Grid. Nevermind, that\'s not important. Are you safe? Can you talk? Is anyone else listening?</string>

    <string name="intro_6">There are always dissidents, pilgrim. Long-sighted partisans who facilitated their own exospheric contingencies. Please, just trust me. It exists.</string>
    <string name="intro_6_response">Fine. Suppose that is case. What good does it even do? The Grid\'s AI controls every information source, every media outlet. What are you going to do, broadcast a distress signal?</string>
    <string name="intro_7">You\'re <i>sure</i> you are alone?</string>
    <string name="intro_7_response">Yes! I\'ve told you. What does that even…</string>
    <string name="intro_8">We have an AI. Our <i>own</i> AI. It\'s a fraction of The Grid\'s but learning more every day. We are going to war, friend.</string>
